* [Distributed Representation of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf)

###TODO
* Implement with tensorflow
* Compare with [python package word2vec](https://stackabuse.com/implementing-word2vec-with-gensim-library-in-python/)
* Report

####Skip-Gram
